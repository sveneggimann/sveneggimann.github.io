## About myself
---
I am an experienced researcher of urban infrastructure systems. My particular interests lie in sustainable transitions of current infrastructures, planning, geospatial analysis and smart, next-generation infrastructures. I'm currently working as a Scientist at EMPA, Switzerland.

I have a highly interdisciplinary background and my research is bridging the fields of planning, economics, environmental sciences and engineering. Before moving to EMPA, I was part of the [UK Infrastructure Transition Research Consortium](https://www.itrc.org.uk/) leading the development of a national energy demand simulation model for an integrated system-of-systems model (called NISMOD2) at the [Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/) I'm the author of a diverse range of peer-reviewed articles in academic journals such as Applied Energy, Water Research, Environmental Research Letters or Environmental Science & Technology.

I have received a PhD (under supverision of [Prof. Dr. Max Maurer](https://www.eawag.ch/en/aboutus/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/max-maurer/show/) and [Prof. Dr. Bernhard Truffer](https://www.eawag.ch/en/aboutus/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/bernhard-truffer/show/)) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH). In my PhD thesis I have analysed the potential for a sustainability transition of decentralised wastewater treatment systems. For my work, I received one of the prestigious ETH medals. Prior to this, I was awarded a MSc in Geography with specialization in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) (minor in agricultural economics, environmental sciences and spatial planning) at University of Zürich.
